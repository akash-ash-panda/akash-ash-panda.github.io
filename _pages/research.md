My research lies at the intersection of **stochastic analysis**, **partial differential equations**, and **applied probability**, with strong motivation from **fluid dynamics**, **continuum mechanics**, and **mathematical biology**. I am particularly interested in both the **theoretical analysis** and **numerical approximation** of stochastic models arising in physics and engineering.

## Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs)
A major part of my work focuses on the **well-posedness theory of SPDEs** driven by Gaussian and non-Gaussian noises. I study existence, uniqueness, regularity, and long-time behavior of solutions under minimal assumptions. Special emphasis is given to equations driven by **multiplicative noise** and **jump (Lévy/Marcus-type) noise**, where classical techniques need substantial refinement.

## Stochastic Fluid Dynamics and Magnetohydrodynamics
I work on stochastic models arising in **fluid mechanics**, including:
- Stochastic **Navier–Stokes equations**
- **Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)** systems
- Coupled fluid–structure models such as **nematic liquid crystal flows**

These problems involve strong nonlinearities, lack of compactness, and delicate stochastic forcing. My research addresses both analytical challenges (well-posedness, blow-up criteria, large deviations) and physically relevant modeling aspects.

## Nonlinear and p-Laplace Type Models
Another research direction concerns **nonlinear PDEs with p-Laplace type operators**, which naturally arise in non-Newtonian fluid models and generalized diffusion processes. I investigate how such nonlinearities interact with stochastic forcing, particularly in MHD and Boussinesq-type systems, and how they affect stability, regularity, and numerical approximation.

## Large Deviations and Asymptotic Analysis
I study **large deviation principles** for stochastic evolution equations, which provide a rigorous framework to quantify rare events and noise-induced transitions. These results are important for understanding asymptotic behavior of stochastic systems in the small-noise regime and have applications in fluid dynamics and mathematical physics.

## Numerical Analysis of Stochastic PDEs
I am interested in the **numerical approximation of SPDEs**, including:
- Finite element methods for stochastic fluid models
- Weak and strong convergence analysis
- Structure-preserving discretizations for coupled systems

My work aims to bridge rigorous stochastic analysis with computational methods suitable for real-world applications.

## Statistical Inference for Stochastic Differential Equations
More recently, I have been working on **statistical inference problems for SDEs**, including nonparametric estimation of drift and diffusion coefficients from discrete data. These problems combine tools from stochastic analysis, probability theory, and statistics, and are motivated by applications in finance and applied sciences.

## Collaboration and Supervision
I am open to research collaborations in the above areas and welcome motivated students interested in **stochastic analysis**, **SPDEs**, and **mathematical modeling**.

Prospective PhD and MSc students are encouraged to contact me with a brief description of their background and research interests.
