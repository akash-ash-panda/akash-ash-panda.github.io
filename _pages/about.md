I am **Akash Ashirbad Panda (Ph.D.)**, **Assistant Professor (Grade I)** in the **School of Basic Sciences (Mathematics)** at **IIT Bhubaneswar**, India (since **3 November 2022**).

## Research interests
My research broadly lies in **stochastic analysis and stochastic PDEs**, with emphasis on
- Well-posedness theory of **Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs)**
- (Stochastic) **nematic liquid crystals** and related physical models (e.g., Navier–Stokes, Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert)
- (Stochastic) **mathematical–biological models**
- **Large deviations** for SPDEs
- **Marcus-type jump noise** and blow-up criteria
- **Numerical methods** (weak/strong approximation) for SPDEs
- **Statistical inference** for stochastic differential equations

## Academic affiliation
- **IIT Bhubaneswar**, School of Basic Sciences (Mathematics), Arugul, Odisha 752050, India
