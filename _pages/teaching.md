## Teaching Philosophy
My teaching philosophy focuses on:
- building **strong analytical foundations**,
- motivating theory through **applications in engineering, physics, and data science**,
- encouraging **research-oriented thinking** at an early stage,
- integrating **computation and simulation** where appropriate.

I strive to create an interactive learning environment that promotes clarity, curiosity, and mathematical maturity.
